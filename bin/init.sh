	$(basename $0) -- This command is for creating new server commands, *not*
	                  for interacting with a server directly

	Commands:

	init:  Initialize a new server. -- You must provide a name for the new
	                                   server, this name will be the name of
	                                   the command that is created.

	share: Add a shared server -- You will need to have ssh access to the
	                              server, and provide a name for the shared
	                              server command

	Examples:
	    $(basename $0) init myserver
	    $(basename $0) init my-awesome-server

	    $(basename $0) share shared-server
	    $(basename $0) share some-project-server
